The CSS property `filter: blur()` doesn't work on some elements when used with certain CSS transforms like `scale()` or `rotate()`. This issue is often inconsistent across browsers and can lead to unexpected visual results.  The blur effect might be completely absent or partially applied, resulting in a distorted or blurry-only section of the element instead of the intended effect on the entire element.
