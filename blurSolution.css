One approach to mitigate this issue is to wrap the element with the transform and blur inside a container. Apply the transform to the container and the blur filter directly to the inner element. This can sometimes isolate the filter from the transform's interference.  Another strategy is to use a different technique to achieve a similar visual effect, like using a background blur via `backdrop-filter` or creating the blur using JavaScript and a canvas element if compatibility isn't a major concern.  Browser-specific CSS prefixes might also be needed in some edge cases. 

```css
/* blurSolution.css */
.container {
  transform: scale(1.2) rotate(10deg);
}

.element {
  filter: blur(5px);
}
```
